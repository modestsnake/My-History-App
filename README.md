In making my history app, I looked back in time and picked three interesting pictures that represent its spirit. One of them is a compass, which was used by explorers to find their way in unknown lands long ago. It reminds us of the adventurous times in history. Next to it, there are ancient paintings that tell stories of conquests and civilizations that have been forgotten over time. The app has a warm, sepia tone, like old books and maps. I chose these colors carefully to make users feel like they're exploring history themselves. The app celebrates old tools like quills, which were used before modern pens to write down stories and events. The app also features faces of famous artists and visionaries from movies and music. They aren't just famous; they inspire us and help us understand people better through their art. When users open the app, they'll see an enlarged text box for easy use. It asks for their age, which helps tailor the experience to them. With a tap, the journey begins â€“ a journey to learn and discover more about history. There are buttons in the app that respond to what users want. One button helps users discover information relevant to their age. It's like a door to the past, letting users explore different times. But sometimes, we need to start fresh. That's where the clear button comes in. It helps users erase their previous searches and start new ones, without any old distractions. My history app isn't just a tool; it's a way to connect with the past. It honors the people who came before us and shows our never-ending curiosity about the world.
